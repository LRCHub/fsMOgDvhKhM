Hi, I'm Oliver Francis, welcome to Jackass
Ooh
Bitch, I'm going in, fuck it

Yeah
Fuck it, all Louis luggage
With my lil' stoner shawty, smokin' marijuana nuggets
Bitch, I'm ballin', ain't nothin' but buckets
Yeah, I'm talking 7 figures, we ain't ballin' on a budget
Baby, fuck with a young rich boy like me
I'm a face yeah, the rapper with like 20 million streams
I don't really know the math but I know my lawyer do
Yeah, my money look like Sonic, boy them hunnids' all blue
Got the instrumental knockin' like its Mechagodzilla
I was fuckin' on lil thottie in them ugly ass Filas, bitch
Go and ask the mic, I'm all killer, no filler
Big dripper, Saint Laurent denim, microphone ripper, uh
Shiny wrist, new fit, all designer too
I'ma need a Kylie and a Kendall too
Flow cold, bitch, you could call it Theraflu
You talking about some Raf? Motherfucker, I might embarrass you
New Godflow, and who got hoes? It's me (I got bitches)
Rubberband Man like T.I.P
And if you see me walk up in the function, everybody showing love
Big drippin', sippin' bubble tea up out his double cup, bitch

Know I'm sipping Henny with a couple bad hoes
Say they never seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors
Pouring up the liquor, we gon' sip it real slow
Put the peddle to the medal, make the wheels burn smoke
Smelling like Givenchy and a big bank roll
Got a couple bitches with me and they all get love
Doing donuts in the Bentley 'til the wheels fall off, yeah
I been gettin' money with my team non-stop, non-stop

Bitch, at the top and we still goin' up
Probably gettin' top up on top the fuckin' tour bus
2015 homie, Oliver was broke as fuck
Now I'm sippin' Malibu rum up out a coconut
Now the fans goin' nuts, sellin' out the shows, bitch
Now I got Christ Gucci'd out head to toe, bitch
Waitin' for the night, a couple Jennys from the block
I just flooded out the wrist, this a tennie not no watch
Yeah, the whip self park, don't need the valet (Skrrrt)
Young Tony Stark, just saved the rap game
With a Gwyneth Paltrow, shoppin' on Rodeo
Mix the Acne blue jeans, with some white Fazos
Got them diamonds in the chest like the gang playin' Minecraft
You can smell the marijuana when the Audi fly past
Bitches with double D's out on the jet skis
Out on South Beach, rockin' designer shoes with double C's
Aye yeah, Amy Lee on my dick,
I'ma smoke woods till my lungs bleed in this shit
I'ma come through lookin' too clean in this bitch
I might fuck you and your girlfriend in a bit, ooh
Ice box, drip, drip, when I walk through
In some Fendi flip flops, chillin' by the pool
Bitch, I'm whippin' a Suburban, sittin' on 22
Chillin' with a Uma Thurman and a Lucy Liu, bitch!

Know I'm sipping Henny with a couple bad hoes
Say they never seen a Chevy with the Butterfly doors
Pouring up the liquor, we gon' sip it real slow
Put the peddle to the medal, make the wheels burn smoke
Smelling like Givenchy and a big bank roll
Got a couple bitches with me and they all get love
Doing donuts in the Bentley 'til the wheels fall off, yeah
I been gettin' money with my team non stop
